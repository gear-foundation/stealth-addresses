     * @param stealthAddress The computed stealth address for the recipient.
     * @param ephemeralPubKey Ephemeral public key used by the sender.
     * @param metadata An arbitrary field MUST include the view tag in the first byte.
     *        Besides the view tag, the metadata can be used by the senders however they like,
     *        but the below guidelines are recommended:
     *        The first byte of the metadata MUST be the view tag.
     *        - When sending/interacting with the native token of the blockchain (cf. ETH), the metadata SHOULD be structured as follows:
     *            - Byte 1 MUST be the view tag, as specified above.
     *            - Bytes 2-5 are `0xeeeeeeee`
     *            - Bytes 6-25 are the address 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE.
     *            - Bytes 26-57 are the amount of ETH being sent.
     *        - When interacting with ERC-20/ERC-721/etc. tokens, the metadata SHOULD be structured as follows:
     *          - Byte 1 MUST be the view tag, as specified above.
     *          - Bytes 2-5 are a function identifier. When a function selector (e.g.
     *            the first (left, high-order in big-endian) four bytes of the Keccak-256
     *            hash of the signature of the function, like Solidity and Vyper use) is
     *            available, it MUST be used.
     *          - Bytes 6-25 are the token contract address.
     *          - Bytes 26-57 are the amount of tokens being sent/interacted with for fungible tokens, or
     *            the token ID for non-fungible tokens.
